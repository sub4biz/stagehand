## 0.9.6

### Patch Changes

- [#2356](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2356) [`04c8ee4`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/04c8ee48ffb6c0b1eae2f201a6d756b679d46355) Thanks [@Kylejeong2](https://github.com/Kylejeong2)! - Replace raw daemon socket connection errors with a human-readable message that includes the exact `browse open` command needed to start the session.

- [#2361](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2361) [`2a6e20b`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/2a6e20b068bb724bdbd3c192b6463acd6b9b817c) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Warn when auto-loading variables from `.env` and add `BROWSE_LOAD_DOTENV` to opt out ahead of a future release where this will be off by default.

## 0.9.5

### Patch Changes

- [#2335](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2335) [`19f9f5a`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/19f9f5a2631573b9952e4df7fbd2c8765c5fac5b) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Add `browse skills show` to print the bundled skill and point agents to it from `--help`.

## 0.9.4

### Patch Changes

- [#2296](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2296) [`2f5e085`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/2f5e085a38aa6d8d52eb33017c64385a75e192cf) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - `browse snapshot` now prints the accessibility tree only by default, omitting the `xpathMap`/`urlMap` ref maps. Pass `--full` to include them. Ref-based element commands are unaffected.

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- [#2310](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2310) [`77a8e92`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/77a8e926ac525264e41a3686808270efd3b4fd9f) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - browse is now also distributed as a Docker image: `ghcr.io/browserbase/browse` (multi-arch `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`, pinned to each release). Lets code sandboxes consume the CLI by image reference without a Dockerfile.

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- [#2284](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2284) [`70b72d3`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/70b72d36907254fb3719ea5f520d37d362a11319) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Add named contexts to the CLI so you can reuse a Browserbase context by a memorable name instead of its ID. `browse cloud contexts create --name <name>` saves a local name→ID alias (stored at `(XDG_CONFIG_HOME||~/.config)/browserbase/contexts.json`, honoring `BROWSERBASE_CONFIG_DIR`), `browse cloud contexts add <name> <id>` names a context you already have, `browse cloud contexts list` shows your saved names, and any place that accepts a context ID — `contexts get|update|delete` and `sessions create --context-id` — now also accepts a saved name. Deleting a context prunes its local alias, and a typo'd name fails with a "did you mean?" hint instead of a cryptic API error. The map is purely client-side: it stores the same IDs the API already returns, and a missing or corrupt file degrades to "no saved contexts" rather than erroring.

- [#2282](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2282) [`b8132f6`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/b8132f6a3350ba5682f6ead07d72f86d34286b16) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Add `--verified` and `--proxies` to remote driver sessions so `browse open <url> --remote --verified --proxies` opens a Verified and/or proxied Browserbase session in one command — no more create-then-attach with `--cdp`.

  - The flags are valid only with `--remote` (they are never implied, since that would silently switch to billed cloud sessions) and are sticky for the session's lifetime like `--headed`/`--headless`: a re-open requesting different settings fails with the usual stop-and-reopen error.
  - Because the session is created through the normal remote path (not a raw `--cdp` attach), it keeps its Browserbase identity and the `browse_cli` attribution tag. `browse status` and `browse doctor` now surface the Browserbase session ID, the dashboard URL, the live-view (debug) URL, and the verified/proxies state.
  - `--verified` requires a Browserbase Scale plan.

- [#2280](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2280) [`39d7638`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/39d7638022b742f9d24776b6dc5d70a992aaeabf) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Honor `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` passed to an already-running driver daemon. Previously, if the first remote command started the daemon without a key, a later `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=… browse open <url> --remote` (or an exported key in a new shell) kept failing with "Missing BROWSERBASE_API_KEY" because the detached daemon captured `process.env` once at spawn time and never saw the new key. The client now forwards the caller's key over the (localhost, owner-only) driver socket with every command, and the daemon threads it straight into the Stagehand constructor when it creates the session — so an inline or exported key works without a manual `browse stop` and restart. The forwarded key is never written back into the daemon's `process.env`; its only home is the live session. Already-initialized warm sessions are untouched; the forwarded key only takes effect at session init. The local-only (CDP-only) build forwards nothing and remains free of any API-key code path.

- [#2297](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2297) [`c18ab34`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/c18ab345e00451237ebd2bcf3567a76bbf1e52a3) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Remove the `browse refs` command. It only re-printed the `xpathMap`/`urlMap` cached from the last `browse snapshot` — which `browse snapshot` already returns — so it was redundant, and it returned stale maps if the page had changed since that snapshot.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- [#2277](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2277) [`263e4d4`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/263e4d437dbdb722b9801488dd8cb40b8d78106e) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Attribute CLI-driven Browserbase usage to an anonymous install. Remote browser sessions now stamp `install_id` and `cli_version` (alongside `browse_cli`) onto `userMetadata`, and cloud Search/Fetch requests send `x-bb-client` and `x-bb-install-id` headers. The install id reuses the existing anonymous telemetry marker; resolution is best-effort and never blocks or fails a command.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2246](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2246) [`303ab2c`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/303ab2c03c68e239c5e27c6fe9f0fa02b12c4749) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - `browse screenshot` now writes a file by default instead of printing base64 to stdout. Bare invocations save to `screenshot-<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>.<type>` in the current directory (with a collision counter instead of overwriting) and print `{ "saved": "<path>" }`. A new `--base64` flag preserves the legacy behavior of printing `{ "base64": "..." }` to stdout; it is mutually exclusive with `--path`. `--path` behavior is unchanged.

  Note for scripts that parsed the bare-invocation base64 output: pass `--base64` to keep the old stdout contract.

### Patch Changes

- [#2250](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2250) [`8b83bb7`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/8b83bb7bb51c81b05014fac4a77bc653a90ca98b) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Fix `browse skills add` on Windows and bound the unbounded installer stages.

  - Quote the `npx` command and arguments when spawning through cmd.exe (`shell: true` for `.cmd`/`.bat` shims), so the default `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd` path and install paths with spaces (e.g. `C:\Users\First Last\...`) no longer split at the space and fail with "'C:\Program' is not recognized".
  - Kill the `npx skills add` child after a 180s deadline (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL) and fail with a clear message and a distinct `skill_install_timeout` telemetry result code instead of hanging forever.
  - Bound the catalog and skill-file fetches with a 10s abort timeout, preserving the existing catalog-unavailable fallback semantics when a fetch hangs.

## 0.8.5

### Patch Changes

- [#2258](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2258) [`2441cd4`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/2441cd4197da67896dca1e4a856673032fd66c74) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Stop headed local sessions from stealing OS focus on every command.

  In headed managed-local mode the browse daemon re-resolved the active page on every subcommand and called `setActivePage()` unconditionally, which ends in a CDP `Target.activateTarget`. On macOS that raises the whole Chrome app to the OS foreground, stealing keyboard focus from the editor/terminal on each `browse navigate/snapshot/get/…` — making the CLI nearly unusable alongside a coding agent and impossible to parallelize. The active tab is now re-activated only when it actually changes; explicit `tab new` / `tab select` still foreground intentionally.

- [#2249](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2249) [`4ee8d99`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/4ee8d9948c143e114b33b8b63b90c75daec1545d) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Add did-you-mean suggestions and telemetry for unknown commands.

  - Unknown commands (e.g. `browse sessions`, `browse search`, `browse auth status` — old Commander-era syntax — plus plain typos like `browse opne`) now print an actionable suggestion on stderr: an explicit alias table maps old syntax to the current command tree, with a Levenshtein nearest-match fallback for typos. The clause is omitted when there is no decent match.
  - A new `cli.command_not_found` telemetry event makes this failure class measurable. Privacy: only the sanitized attempted command id and the computed suggestion are sent — never raw argv, which can contain URLs, selectors, or secrets.
  - oclif's standard "command not found" error and exit code 2 are preserved; no new runtime dependency (deliberately avoids `@oclif/plugin-not-found`, which prompts interactively and is agent-hostile).

- [#2248](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2248) [`cffcc91`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/cffcc91add8edc1f9b9f0846b36ecb8ea51605d0) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Make driver (browser session) failures actionable, classified, and self-correcting.

  - An invalid `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` no longer surfaces a bare `401 Unauthorized`: remote init failures are classified (401 invalid key, 403 permissions/plan, other) into actionable messages that point at the key settings page, `--local`, and `browse doctor`.
  - A missing local Chrome now explains how to install Chrome, attach with `--cdp`, or switch to remote, instead of leaking chrome-launcher internals.
  - Cached init failures back off exponentially (5s doubling, capped at 5 minutes) and append a "failing repeatedly" hint after 3 consecutive failures, so retry-looping agents get a clear self-correction signal instead of instant identical errors forever.
  - The daemon protocol now carries optional `code`/`httpStatus` on error responses (backward compatible), and the client records them as telemetry result codes — `open` failures stop being 94% `unexpected`. New codes include `remote_auth_401`, `remote_auth_403`, `remote_session_create_failed`, `no_chrome_found`, `stale_ref`, `no_active_page`, `daemon_lock_timeout`, `daemon_unresponsive`, `daemon_socket_timeout`, and `daemon_spawn_failed`.

- [#2201](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2201) [`9971a7b`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/9971a7b3d8ecca255b4548cfb9128657c053cca7) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Add Chrome launch arg flags for managed local browser sessions: `--chrome-arg <flag>` (repeatable) appends launch args on top of Chrome's defaults, `--ignore-default-chrome-arg <flag>` (repeatable) drops specific default args, and `--no-default-chrome-args` launches without any of Chrome's defaults.

- [#2251](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2251) [`3ecf09e`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/3ecf09eabb7f3cd107bf64378664416597e912c8) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Emit a `skill_id` property on `cli.command_completed` telemetry.

  The validated, catalog-public skill id (e.g. `yelp.com/extract-reviews`, or `bundled/browse` for `skills install`) is attached to the completion event for `browse skills add`/`install`, covering both successful installs and every downstream failure path (`skill_not_found`, `skill_install_failed`, ...). Only the parsed, regex-validated id is ever attached — never the raw argument.

## 0.8.4

### Patch Changes

- [#2213](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2213) [`7449046`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/7449046647c30800404c333dd604bacccba0aa7c) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - fix(cli): request the full template catalog via scope=all so `browse templates list` returns all templates, not just playground-runnable ones

- [#2210](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2210) [`a9552fd`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/a9552fde629a2b13bc32dedc002e401af90b866c) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Make `browse skills add` failures diagnosable and fail cleanly on unknown skills.

  - Unknown (non-generated) skill ids now fail fast with an actionable "not found in the catalog" message pointing at `browse skills find`/`browse skills list`, instead of silently git-cloning the entire browse.sh repo and exiting with an opaque error.
  - The `npx skills add` child's output is now buffered (tail) while still streaming live to the terminal, so a nonzero exit surfaces the real reason instead of a bare exit code.
  - Failures now record distinct telemetry result codes (`skill_not_found`, `invalid_skill_id`, `npx_missing`, `skill_install_failed`) so the failure modes are measurable.
  - `browse skills add` with no argument now prints actionable guidance (the `<domain>/<task>` form plus `browse skills find`) instead of oclif's bare "Missing 1 required arg".

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- [#2192](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/pull/2192) [`e7d3b55`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/commit/e7d3b55f69f2a1fd75e92dea8f831f96fa6180d3) Thanks [@shrey150](https://github.com/shrey150)! - Lead-with-local onboarding: the missing-API-key error on cloud commands now tells users that local browser automation needs no key and points them to `browse open <url> --local`. The remote-mode driver error is clearer about when a key is required versus when local mode works without one.
